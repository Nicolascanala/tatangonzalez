This is my first ever project. 

I had only been coding for 3 weeks and a relative needed a photographer portfolio website. I decided to give it a shot. As you can see, the end result is not very charming (in terms of the code), but it does show that I tried hard and that I managed to achieve my goal. It was a difficult task, I barely even knew HTML! But I followed lots of online mentor's adivce: if you're not sure of what to do: google it.

This code does not represent my current level. I have come a long way from this!
